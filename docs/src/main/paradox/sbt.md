# sbt

To get started with Akka gRPC read the [client](client.md) or [server](server.md) introductions.

## Only generating the server or client side

It can be configured to just generate either server or client like so:

```scala
// This is the default - both client and server
akkaGrpcGeneratedSources := Seq(AkkaGrpc.Server, AkkaGrpc.Client)

// only client
akkaGrpcGeneratedSources := Seq(AkkaGrpc.Client)

// only server
akkaGrpcGeneratedSources := Seq(AkkaGrpc.Server)
```

What language to generate stubs for is also configurable:
```
// default is Scala only
akkaGrpcTargetLanguages := Seq(AkkaGrpc.Scala)

// Java only
akkaGrpcTargetLanguages := Seq(AkkaGrpc.Java)

// Both Java and Scala, by default the 'flat_package' option is enabled generated sources look
// consistent between Scala and Java. With both languages enabled you need to disable that option to
// avoid name conflicts
akkaGrpcTargetLanguages := Seq(AkkaGrpc.Java, AkkaGrpc.Scala)
akkaGrpcCodeGeneratorSettings := akkaGrpcCodeGeneratorSettings.value.filterNot(_ == "flat_package")
```

Passing generator parameters to the underlying ScalaPB generators can be done through `akkaGrpcCodeGeneratorSettings`
setting, any specified options will be passed to all underlying generators that are enabled. By default this setting
contains the `flat_package` parameter.

```
akkaGrpcCodeGeneratorSettings += "single_line_to_proto_string"
```

Available parameters are listed in the [ScalaPB documentation](https://scalapb.github.io/sbt-settings.html).

## Proto source directory

You can configure where your .proto files are located like this:

sbt
:   @@snip[build.sbt]($root$/../plugin-tester-java/build.sbt) { #protoSources }

## Loading proto files from artifacts

Instead of duplicating the `.proto` definitions between server and client projects, you can add artifacts
that contain proto definitions to your build:

```scala
libraryDependencies +=
  "com.example" %% "my-grpc-service" % "1.0.0" % "protobuf"
```
