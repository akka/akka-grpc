# gRPC-Web

@@@note

This feature is **experimental**.

The Java/Scala API's to enable this feature may still change in further
versions of Akka gRPC, and future versions of this feature may not work with
services generated with older versions of Akka gRPC.

There may be missing features and bugs in the current implementation. If you
encounter any, you are welcome to share a reproducer in our
[issue tracker](https://github.com/akka/akka-grpc/issues).

gRPC cannot be used directly from the browser because of limitations on the
amount of control the Javascript code has on the behavior of the browser.

The [gRPC-Web](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/PROTOCOL-WEB.md#readme)
protocol was designed to be usable from a browser, but be easily translatable
into native gRPC calls.

The most common deployment model of gRPC-Web is to use a proxy such
as [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http/http_filters/grpc_web_filter)
to translate between the gRPC-Web frontend and a native gRPC back-end.
This is a great choice with Akka gRPC services.

However, in some situations it may be operationally simpler if your service
supports gRPC-Web directly. This is now possible with Akka gRPC as well.

To serve a gRPC service with Akka gRPC, it is recommended to serve the
native gRPC protocol on a different port than gRPC-Web, as the two protocols
will likely require a different security story. You can use
@apidoc[WebHandler.grpcWebHandler](WebHandler$) to serve your
gRPC-Web endpoint with basic CORS infrastructure in place. To use CORS,
you will need to add the akka-http-cors dependency to your project:

@@dependency[sbt,Maven,Gradle] {
  group="ch.megard"
  artifact="akka-http-cors_2.12"
  version="0.4.2"
}

And then serve the handlers with @apidoc[WebHandler.grpcWebHandler](WebHandler$) like this:

Java
