Test project, detached from the parent, to test our plugins in Java projects.

Currently contains a Gradle project, but could be extended with maven and sbt.

Currently the plugin generates scala code (because we don't have an option
to generate Java code yet), so leaving this project in its current state until
we have Java code generation in place.
